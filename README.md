## Introduction

This project aims to predict real estate prices in Bangalore, using various features of properties such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant data. By applying machine learning, this project helps provide an estimate for property prices, which can assist potential buyers, investors, and real estate professionals.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Collection**: Compiling property data, including details such as location, area, price, number of bedrooms, and more.
2. **EDA**: Analyzing patterns in property prices based on location and other factors.
3. **Data Processing**: Handling missing values and performing feature engineering for optimal model performance.
4. **Modeling**: Training predictive models to estimate property prices.
5. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance with metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Libraries**:
  - **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-Learn
  - **Metrics**: RMSE, MAE

## Data Collection

The dataset contains details of real estate properties in Bangalore, including:

- **Location**: City area where the property is located
- **Size**: Square footage or number of bedrooms
- **Price**: The target variable representing property price
- **Additional Features**: Information like bathrooms, balconies, amenities, etc.

This data was pre-processed and cleaned for effective analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights were drawn from the data by exploring relationships between features like:

- Location and price distribution
- Price per square foot
- Trends in property prices for different numbers of bedrooms

### Sample EDA Code

```python
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('bangalore_real_estate.csv')

# Price distribution
sns.histplot(data['price'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.title("Price Distribution")
plt.show()
```
